# Random Number Generator
A cool little  `HTML` page that generates a random number using Math.Random() from JavaScript.

## Maximum digits
 When opening the page, It'll ask you how many maximum digits the numbers are going to have. For example, if you type 4, the generated numbers'll be between 0 - 9999.

## How can I change the cifres?
Just reload the page, and the window that asks you that will pop out again  :D

## How do I get the generated number?
For now, you can triple-left-click on the number shuffling to highlight the label, then just press *Ctrl + C* to copy a number so you can paste it wherever you want.

## So.. Is the zer0 included?
Yes.. zero is a number so.. yes.

## Where did you get those colorful *blobs* and *waves* designs?
I generated them using a website called [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app/) by [z creative labs](https://zcreativelabs.com/), used for generating awesome web-designs like the one i used (actually pretty cool).
